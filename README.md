### Deep Neural Mouse Brain Modeling

[colinconwell.github.io/DeepMouseTrap/](https://colinconwell.github.io/DeepMouseTrap/)

This is the repository for the ongoing deep neural mouse modeling project, an attempt to characterize the representational structure of rodent visual cortex with a combination of optical and electrophysiology data from the Allen Brain Observatory and a veritable boatload of neural networks. 

An accompanying Google Colab notebook ([bit.ly/Neural-Cheese](https://bit.ly/Neural-Cheese)) contains a brief tutorial on the use of many parts of this code, including the parsing of the neurophysiology data, deep net feature extraction, and deep net modeling of the neurophysiology data.

An article (appearing in NeurIPS2021) that uses these methods may be found [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/file/2c29d89cc56cdb191c60db2f0bae796b-Paper.pdf).
