### Deep Neural Mouse Brain Modeling

This is the repository for the ongoing deep neural mouse modeling project, an attempt to characterize the representational structure of rodent visual cortex with a combination of optical physiology data from the Allen Brain Observatory and a veritable boatload of neural networks. 

An accompanying Google Colab notebook contains a brief tutorial on the use of many parts of this code, including the parsing of the neurophysiology data, deep net feature extraction, and deep net modeling of the neurophysiology data.
